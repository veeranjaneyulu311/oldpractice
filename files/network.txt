#ip=32bit
#packet=data+sender addr(ip)+Des addr(ip)

#to access any service we need following
  {network id}+{host id}+{process id i.e port}

#we have different classes

first ip in a network is used for network id
last ip is for Direct Broadcast address[all hosts in other network i.e {NID.255.255.255}]
255.255.255.255 used for Limited Brodcast address[all hosts within same network]
0.0.0.0 used for default route if no network id matched in route table 
subnet mask={all 1's for NID & subnetId  }{all 0's for hostbits}=to finally get network id
 i.e 1's indicate [NID+SID]
     0's indicate HID

from subnet mask we can find no.of ip's in a network
but to find no.of subnets we must know no.of SID bits.it can be find if we know class i.e A/B/C
Routing Table:
==============
NID                   SM               Interface(path)


router takes destination ip from packet and performs bitwiseor with SM to find matching NID

#VLSM:
======
* we get subnet by selecting bits from hostpart
*subnets with same no.of hosts will have same subnet mask
  ex:

subnet mask =large =less no.of hosts(i.e size)
