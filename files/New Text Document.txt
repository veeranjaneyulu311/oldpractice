This Paper presents Microstrip patch antenna for WiMAX communication system which operate at 5.8 GHz frequency band. The main objective of this paper is to design and observe the performance of the designed microstrip patch antenna for different dielectric materials. The size of the designed antenna has been also miniaturized. Better performance is observed for FR4 and dupont-951 dielectric material. For FR4 radiation efficiency is-2.776 dB and total efficiency is -3.026 dB at 5.8 GHz, this indicates better performance. And for dupont-951 the return loss is much lower comparing to the other dielectric materials used in this research, which is -16.609 dB. Also for dupont-951 and FR4, VSWR is found 1.35 and 1.7 respectively which is desirable. Also the size of the antenna has been reduced. In this paper we also observed and analyzed the radiation pattern of far field region, gain, radiation efficiency and total efficiency for different dielectric materials.
